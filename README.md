# SHOGun GIS client

This repository contains the default WebGIS client used within the [SHOGun project](https://github.com/terrestris/shogun-docker).

The client was initialized with [create-react-geo-app](https://github.com/terrestris/create-react-geo-app).

## Installation üíæ

We recommend to install the client via the prebuilt Docker image `docker-public.terrestris.de/terrestris/shogun-gis-client`.

## Usage üñ±Ô∏è

Even if the client can be used without any backend providing a context configuration, it is designed to run on top of a [SHOGun backend](https://github.com/terrestris/shogun) while reading the configuration from the [`/applications`](https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terrestris/shogun/gh-pages/api/swagger.json#/application-controller)  REST interface. To specify a configuration the query parameter `applicationId` must be set (e.g. `https://localhost/client/?applicationId=18` to get the configuration for the application with the ID 18).
If no ID is given (e.g. because no backend is available) or the requested application is not accessible, the client will load a fallback configuration.
It is possible to load the application config from a static URL with the configuration parameter `staticAppConfigUrl`.

### Print
To use print apps for different languages just name them after the language code (`ISO_639-1`). The print app that has the name of the currently selected language will be used.

## Configuration üé®

Several global settings for the client can be configured via the [`gis-client-config.js`](https://github.com/terrestris/shogun-gis-client/blob/main/resources/config/gis-client-config.js) file:

| layerConfigUrl | An URL to load a list of layers, this does not have to come from shogun but has to have the same syntax (See https://github.com/terrestris/shogun-util/blob/main/src/model/Layer.ts).                    | undefined           |

The configuration file is not bundled and will be loaded before application start from `./gis-client-config.js`. Typically you want to override the file in a production environment and you can pass a custom file by mounting the desired one directly into the nginx container of the client. For example:

```yml
version: '3.7'
services:
  shogun-gis-client:
    image: docker-public.terrestris.de/terrestris/shogun-gis-client:latest
    volumes:
      - ./gis-client-config.js:/usr/share/nginx/html/gis-client-config.js
    (‚Ä¶)
```

The [shogun-docker](https://github.com/terrestris/shogun-docker) repository shows an alternative (and the preferred) way by providing the configuration file out of the root-nginx service while having support for dynamic environment variable replacement.

## Development üßë‚Äçüíª

Checkout the repository and install all required dependencies via

```
npm i
```

While it's absolutely possible to run the client via

```
npm run start
```

to have the application available at [https://localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080) you usually want to start the full SHOGun stack for development. Please refer to the [shogun-docker](https://github.com/terrestris/shogun-docker) repository for further details.

### Development if shogun-gis-client is a dependency of your project

Injects the local version of shogun-gis-client into another project. This can be useful when developing https://github.com/terrestris/shogun-gis-client-plugins

```sh
npx watch-build-copy ./src "npm run build:dist" ./dist/ ../shogun-gis-client-plugins/node_modules/@terrestris/shogun-gis-client/dist
```

## End-to-End testing using Playwright

Ensure using the latest version of the E2E-Test package:

```
npm update @terrestris/shogun-e2e-tests
```

Set your domain including potential paths as the ¬¥process.env.HOST¬¥ variable in the [global-setup.js](./global-setup.js). For example:

```
shogun.terrestris.de
```

To run the E2E-tests locally just use the following command in the commandline:

```
npx playwright test
```

## Road to production üè≠

The build artifact of the client can either be built via

```
npm run build
```

or directly included in an `nginx` based Docker image via:

```
docker build -t shogun-gis-client:1.0.0 .
```

Run `docker run -p 80:80 shogun-gis-client:1.0.0` to start it locally.
